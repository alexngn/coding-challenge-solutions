This is a modified djkstra's search
Keep in mind that you will never need to go beyond the kth distance to any node
to find the kth distance of any other node since edge weights are all positive

The kth time you process a node in your BFS will be the kth distance to that node
Prune any node if you have processed that node k times already.
