Do djkstra's algorithm from the source and the destination (1 and n)

Create a transpose of the original graph to use as djkstra's from the destination
Where dist[a][b] = c and distTranspose[b][a] = c

Iterate through each edge and compare the distance from source to start of the edge + 
Node n to end of the edge + half the edge weight.

Return the minimum among all edge comparisons
