First run bellman for to create single source shortest paths to all nodes.
Iterate through each edge to see if an edge can further be relaxed.
If it can, there is a negative cycle. 
Use parent pointers and keep traversing upwards until you reach a node that has been seen.
Print the nodes from that traversal
