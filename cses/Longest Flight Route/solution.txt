Create a topological ordering of the graph.
When processing the next node in the topological ordering:
- If the current node does not have a distance, ignore it
- If the distance to the current node + 1 is larger than the distance of the edge
    - Update the edge to be the distance of the current node + 1
    - Update the parent pointer of the edge to be the node
