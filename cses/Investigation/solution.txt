If the neighbor + edge.weight is less than the current recorded distance for the neighbor
1. Update min distance
2. Record the number of routes for the neighbor as the same as the curr node
3. Record the minFlights for the neighbor as the same as the curr node
4. Record the maxFlights for neighbor as the same as the curr node

if the neighbor.weight + edge.weight is equal to the current recorded distance
1. Record the number of routes for the neighbor as routes[neigh] += routes[curr]
2. Record the min and max as the min and max of curr + 1
3. Do NOT add the neighbors to the PQ as this will TLE 
- This is not needed since the neigbor being updated is still in the queue and will update it's neighbors when it's prcoessed
